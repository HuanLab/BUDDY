BUDDY is an open-source cheminformatic software platform developed for MS-based metabolomics research, capitalizing on **bottom-up MS/MS interrogation** and **experiment-specific global peak annotation**.

Bottom-up MS/MS interrogation aims to determine molecular formulae for all metabolic features with significance estimation. Experiment-specific global peak annotation is achieved to select the optimal molecular network considering both individual peak annotations and peak interrelationships. For detailed methodology, please refer to our paper.

Wish you a wonderful journey in BUDDY!
