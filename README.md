`BUDDY` is an open-source cheminformatic software platform developed for MS-based metabolomics research, capitalizing on **bottom-up MS/MS interrogation** and **experiment-specific global peak annotation**.

Bottom-up MS/MS interrogation aims to determine molecular formulae for all metabolic features with significance estimation. Experiment-specific global peak annotation is achieved to select the optimal molecular network considering both individual peak annotations and peak interrelationships.

## Quick Start (BUDDY GUI version)
### Installation
`BUDDY` can be freely downloaded on this [GitHub release page](https://github.com/Philipbear/BUDDY_Metabolomics/releases).

We provide a graphical user interface shown as below.

### Task
- MS/MS library search
- Bottom-up MS/MS interrogation
- Experiment-specific global peak annotation
### File import 
- Single query import (pop-up window) 
- Batch import (metabolic feature table, mzML file, mgf file)
### Result export
- Single export (a single query feature) 
- Batch export in a hierarchical manner (file – metabolic feature – candidate formula – explained MS/MS)

## User Manual
