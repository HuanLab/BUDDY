> **Note**:
`msbuddy` is newly developed for flexible molecular formula analysis with refined algorithmic design and model training.
`msbuddy` will be actively updated, and `BUDDY` is now archived due to the restriction of usage on different operating systems. We aim to provide a more customizable and more accurate solution.
